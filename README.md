# Analog Synth Emulator

This Qt application connects to a midi device and uses it to control an emulated analog synthesizer. 


This is based on a partner project done for the CS312 class at Carleton College. It was a collaboration between me (Thomas Bertschinger) and Tore Banta (https://github.com/bantat/). 

# Dependencies

In addition to Qt, this application uses 
* [RtAudio](https://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/) with the ALSA backend
* [RtMidi](https://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/)
